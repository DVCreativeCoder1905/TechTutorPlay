# Security Policy - TechTutorPlay Lab

## Professional Integrity & Compliance
TechTutorPlay Lab is committed to the highest standards of professional and legal integrity. 
* **Zero Tolerance for Piracy:** We strictly avoid the use of "leaked" or unauthorized "Investor Codes," licenses, or cracked software. All assets are obtained through official channels (GitHub Education, Microsoft Founders Hub, etc.).
* **Intellectual Property:** We respect all third-party EULAs and Terms of Service.

## Security Infrastructure
The security of this repository and our local development environment is managed with a multi-layered approach:

* **Local Stack Security: Development is performed on a secured, private local environment (AMD Ryzen 9 7900X3D / RTX 5070) with encrypted local storage on dedicated drives.
